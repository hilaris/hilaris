 * @brief Read the contents of a BMP image
 * 
 * Open the specified .bmp file and check the header for validity. Only
 * 24 bit color depth and 8 bit greyscale with no compression or
 * color tables are supported.
 * If the caller writes the expected image format to the OSC_PICTURE
 * struct beforehand, these assumptions are checked. Also, the caller can
 * specify the memory location to load the picture to by specifying the
 * data member of the OSC_PICTURE. Otherwise the required memory is
 * allocated. When specifying the destination address, the expected
 * image format must also be specified to avoid overflow.
 * If the picture in the file has the row order reversed, this is
 * corrected. The returned row order is top to bottom.
 * 
 * The data in a RGB color BMP is stored with the pixel order BGR, so
 * that is the format in which the data is returned.
